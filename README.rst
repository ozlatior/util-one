Util One - a utility library for nodejs
***************************************

Util One contains a set of functions that are consistently missing and being required in other
projects, mostly dealing with handling arrays, objects, strings paths and so on.

To include in your code and use::

    const u1 = require("util-one");
    // u1.array, u1.bitwise, u1.html, u1.object, u1.string, u1.path

For now there is no more documentation than this, I'll add to it when I have time. I'll also keep
extending the library as I need more functionality.
